This is an attampt at creating an online streaming cinema extention for chrome

The idea is:

1. Each loads its own version of youtube plaier so to not fall under the DMCA claim
2. The twitch or youtube stream is added to the local page
3. The streamer controls the viewing experience



TODO:


1. Open a blank window with some words
2. Add embeded youtube video
3. Add twitch chat and twitch stream
4. Two main actions to control viewing experience: 
    1 Pause video.
    2 Start video. 
    3 scroll to a specific time.
